//This file aims at providing the functionality to add a task in the project backlog page,
//*This is done by the following steps: 
// Step 1: User clicks on Add a task button
// Step 2: This takes the user to a new page called "createYourTask.html"
// Step 3: This page includes a form-style data input
// Step 4: user enters their details about the task
// Step 5: The user presses done when they have entered all the required fields
// Step 6: The details are then added to local storage object under the KEY "ProjectBacklogItems --> PBIS"
// Step 7: The user is returned to the main Project backlog page, where they can now see a dynammically made div of the project backlog item
// Step 8: The project backlog item shows the summarised information of priority, story points and tag
// Step 9: When the project backlog div item is created dynamically, a button is also dynamically created at the bottom right hand corner, this 
//          button can allow a user to see the detailed view of the  task
// step 10: When viewing the detailed view of the task, the details are not editable, however, a user should be able to "edit task details" 
// Step 11: This "edit task details" button takes a user to a pre-filled - editable - form, allowing them to edit any detail in the form that they want.
